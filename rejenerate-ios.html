            <h1>rejenerate - iOS User Interface Design</h1>

            <h2>A Focus on Wellness</h2>
            <p>
                Wellness has been a major theme and even more so since the pandemic. With shops now being open again,
                people should still be able to
                obtain wellness products from the comfort of their own home. This is the purpose of the reJenerate
                shopping app.
            </p>

            <img class="image-50" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; "
                src="img/rejenerate-ios/reJenerate-name.png" alt="Rejenerate Logo">

            <h2>What problem are we trying to solve?</h2>
            <p>The overall mission is to help users purchase or return wellness products without having to leave their
                house.
                How can we help users the right materials for their wellness needs from the comfort of their own home?
            </p>


            <h2>A Brand to Support Wellness for Everybody</h2>
            <h3>Lotus Flower</h3>
            <p>The lotus flower has different meanings across cultures and is known as a symbol of purity,
                strength, resilience and rebirth. </p>
            <h3>Spiritual Energy Field</h3>
            <p>The blue dots represent a spiritual energy field emerging from the flower and the intention of the
                products to support the user in their 'regeneration' journey from within.
            </p>
            <img class="image-75" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; "
                src="img/rejenerate-ios/rejenerate-logo.png" alt="Rejenerate Logo">

            <img class="image-100" src="img/rejenerate-ios/portfolio-desktop.png" alt="Desktop design">


            <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
            <p>This app was designed for for those who need to recharge, which is pretty much like everybody. They are
                motivated by seeing how wellness has positively impacted others and their goal is to
                feel energized, at peace and at their best; both with themselves and with others. The primary challenge
                for them is that finding wellness items involves going to crowded shopping centers and
                navigating through isles. This form of shopping does not give them the time and space to really
                explore and reflect on what they want to purchase.
            </p>

            <h2>Empathizing with users</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes (but not always), new users who are seeking wellness products may
                already be experiencing
                some challenges or just have need for more peace in their lives. This is likely to mean that they would
                also rather not spend their time going to a post-office to return items. Customer service will be just
                as important as the
                products themselves.
            </p>

                alt="High Fidelity Mockups">



            <h2>Different Ways to Communicate the Brand</h2>
            <p>The reJenerate mark will be used throughout the website, on print and on various types of eco-friendly
                bags and boxes.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/rejenerate-ios/rejenerate-logo-variations.png"
                alt="Rejenerate Logo Variations">

            <h2>Brand Colors</h2>
            <h3>Combining warm and cool</h3>
            <p>The brand features warm colors with one cool color, blue, as an accent. The warm colors
                are inviting and gently stand out. The blue gives a sense of peace and serenity.
            </p>
            <h3>Primary and accent colors</h3>
            <p>The primary color is intended to be beautiful, elegant and mystical.</p>
            <p>The accent color is used to bring attention to specific details, which is why it is cool and contrasts
                strongly
                with the primary color.
                Combining this with the warm colors should give positive emotions to the user</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/rejenerate-ios/rejenerate-primary-and-accent.png"
                alt="Primary and Accent Color">
            <h3>Secondary colors</h3>
            <p>The secondary colors are warm, welcoming and diverse enough to be used in illustrations.
                The third color, salmon is actually not used in the logo but will support illustrations used as the
                brand grows.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/rejenerate-ios/rejenerate-secondary.png" alt="Secondary Color">

            <h2>Mindful</h2>
            <h3>"The service is amazing"</h3>
            <p>The core mission is to provide users with items that will assist them in their wellness and
                mindfullness journey. The benefits should be felt from the moment they visit the website,
                through the entire purchasing process, the products themselves and the return or exchange process.</p>

            <h2>Inclusive</h2>
            <h3>"I love how they explain so clearly the benefits of this type of cushion"</h3>
            <p>The brand should appeal to all genders and ages. This means not avoiding overcomplicated mindful
                vocabulary or terms that the everyday person may have difficulty grasping. Wellness should be accessible
                to
                everybody who access the shop.</p>

            <h2>Practical</h2>
            <h3>I drink this tea literally every single morning</h3>
            <p>The store has curated a collection of very practical and high quality wellness products. The mission is
                not
                to make money from temporary souvenir-like items but rather to provide people with things they can
                integrate
                into their daily life.</p>

            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <h3>Single font brand</h3>
            <p>Users may want to read detailed information about how to best use the products. Quicksand is a readable,
                modern and therefore very calming typeface to read.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/rejenerate-ios/rejenerate-fonts.png" alt="Secondary Color">
            <p>I normally like to mix a serif with a san-serif but, I decided to stick with one font, while the brand is
                young.</p>

            <h2>Wellness isn't about fancy yoga poses</h2>
            <p>And it isn't about fancy club memberships. It is about the preventative or restorative things we can do
                throughout the day to make our lives
                better. </p>
            <img class="image-100" style="padding-bottom: 5%;" src="img/rejenerate-ios/portfolio-hifi-02.png"
                alt="High Fidelity Mockups">
            <h2>Practical products</h2>
            <p>
                A wellness product can be as simple as a forgiving cup of tea. Tea is an everyday item that users would
                likely
                want to try varieties of and order regularly without
                having to
                always run to the store.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" style="padding-bottom: 5%;" src="img/rejenerate-ios/portfolio-hifi-03.png"
                alt="High Fidelity Mockups">

            <h2>User Stories and User Fow</h2>
            <h3>Purchasing products is only a small part of the experience. The brand is keen to help users grow and
                continue on their wellness journey while they:</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore products</li>
                <li>Search and find what they need</li>
                <li>Learn and share</li>
                <li>Get recommendations</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <img class="image-100" style="padding-bottom: 5%;"
                src="img/rejenerate-ios/portfolio-user-stories-and-flow.png" alt="User Stories and User Flow">

            <h2>Low-Fidelity Design</h2>
            <h3>A clean design for a clear mind</h3>
            <p>
                If there is one thing this user interface will not have, it is the bells and whistles of some of our
                popular shopping apps (though I understand bells and whistles have their place for other purposes).
                The app has a very simple navigation and the only flags
                they will get will
                be for sale items, or items recommended based on their past purchases.
            </p>

            <img class="image-100" style="padding-bottom: 5%;" src="img/rejenerate-ios/portfolio-low-fi.png"
                alt="Low Fidelity Screens (grey boxing)">

            <p>The app came out just as I had envisioned at the beginning of the design process. It looks like an online
                wellness store and
                feels like a clean shopping experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Medium-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/rejenerate-ios/rejenerate-prototype.png"
                alt="Medium Fidelity Prototype (with content)">

            <h2>Retrospective</h2>
            <h3>What was the overall experience like?</h3>
            <p>This app was an immense pleasure for me to design beause it touched on a topic that I am
                very supportive and excited about.
            </p>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>While this design was UI focused, it made clear to me the importance of doing a card sort, in order
                to determine how to best categorize items for users.
            </p>
            <h3>What I would do differently?</h3>
            <p>I think the Logo could be enhanced a little bit more to make it even more unique. This can be done
                with the arrangement of the blue dots.
            </p>

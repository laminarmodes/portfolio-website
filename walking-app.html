            <h1>Outdoor Walking - Responsive Web App Design</h1>

            <h2>Location-Based Walking Recommendations for Outdoor Walks</h2>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">“And into the forest I go, to lose my mind and find my soul”</span>
                <br> ― John Muir
            </p>

            <p>Everybody can benefit from a nice long refreshing walk but sometimes this requires some advanced
                planning.
                A one-stop app can make the searching, deciding, sharing and planning process much simpler and
                enjoyable.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/device-02.png" alt="All screens on iPhones">
            <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>The urge to get outside can come at any time; while in the office, during flight, or in the middle of the
                night. We should be able to plan in advance from our work laptop, or on the fly from our phone.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/device-mockups-forward-small1.png"
                alt="Laptop, iPhone, iPad mini, iPad">

            <h3>High quality photographs guide browsing</h3>
            <p>Deciding on an outdoor adventure should be as fun and pleasant as the adventure itself. The photographic
                content will have the
                biggest influence on how the user decides to navigate the app, and is therefore the most important UI
                element.
            </p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/mockup-scene-05.jpeg"
                alt="Home screen on iPhone on table with map">

            <h3>Simplifying the decision making process</h3>
            <p>There is no need to have several tabs open while deciding. All of the essential information can be found
                in one glance including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Detailed maps with the actual path
                </li>
                <li>
                    Walk features (e.g. lakes, picnic spots, bird watching)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Weather forecasts relevant to the selected walk
                </li>
                <li>Indication of the level of difficulty and estimated completion time</li>
                <li>Photographic and information waypoint details</li>
                <li>Reviews from other visitors</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The user can save their ideas, share with others and
                schedule into their own calendar.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/mockup-scene-02.jpeg"
                alt="Details screen on iPad in person's hand outside">

            <h3>Immersive as the user wants</h3>
            <p>Some of my users mentioned that they were walking alone and so waypoint photo and video
                functionality
                gives the user even more opportunities to engage with the app if they choose to do so during their walk.
            </p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/mockup-scene-04.png"
                alt="Waypoint screen on iPhone, projected onto actual scene">
            <h3>The Best Part</h3>
            <p>The most striking part of the UI will be the photographs because they will be both professional and
                crowd sourced (accepted after a screen process for quality). Searching for a walk will feel like an
                adventure by itself.</p>

            <h2>Designed Using a Lean UX Process</h2>
            <p>I learned from working with product teams that it is very important to make a plan, stick with it, and
                limit the scope of deliverables to artifacts that deliver insights or increment the design.
            </p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/lean-ux-process-compressed.png" alt="The Journey">

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>A competitive analysis of three different location-based
                recommendation apps helped to shed light on what opportunities exist to stand out in the market.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/01-competative-analysis.jpg" alt="The Journey">

            <h2>Personas</h2>

            <h3>HEART</h3>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Did the design come from a place of deep empathy?</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Did the work inspire people to take action?</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Did the process instill a deeper understanding of those we're
                    designing for?</span>
                <br>
                --IDEO
            </p>

            <p>User interviews are the hardest part of the UX process because it
                requires convincing people
                to have what seems like the dreaded, 'meeting' with you. But once the scheduling and preparation is
                done, the actual
                interview itself can be pretty fun, even for the user.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/03-personas.png" alt="Personas">

            <h3>Who is this app perfect for? </h3>
            <p>All of the users brought up their feelings of discomfort or lack of confidence when selecting to
                navigating unfamiliar walks. This was
                especially the case when walking alone. The users shared that knowing in advance what to expect in the
                form of photographs
                would make their experience more pleasant.
            </p>

            <h2>The journey is just as important as the destination</h2>
            <h3>MVP Definition</h3>
            <p>User feedback built the foundation for the Minimum Viable Product of an app that would help the users
                search for and navigate
                the best routes for them.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/02a-mvp-document.jpg" alt="MVP document">

            <h2>Jobs To Be Done</h2>
            <p>Every functionality should deliver an output, that leads to an outcome that will benefit the personas.
                One
                habit I made sure to avoid is the "Wouldn't it be nice if...", "How about if...", or any temptation to
                add features
                that are not necessary for the user to get their job done.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/02b-mvp-document.jpg" alt="Jobs to be done">


            <h2>User Flow for Each 'Job To Be Done'</h2>
            <h3>BRAINS</h3>
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Was the approach to discovery and design rigorous and
                    comprehensive?</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Does the work feel smart, clever, or novel?</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Is the design informed by a clear strategic intent?</span>
                <br>
                --IDEO
            </p>
            <p>To me, the user flow is the most fascinating part of the design process because it is where the User
                Experience is
                ready to become a User Interface.</p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/user-flow-final.png" alt="Final use flow">


            <h2>Ideation </h2>
            <h3>Crazy 8's</h3>
            <p>The Crazy 8 ideation method is a very intense divergent phase. From past experience, I have found it a
                little challenging to guide users through this as a workshop exercise because the short time limit seems
                to have a stressing affect on people.
            </p>
            <p>I highly recommend to extend the time for Crazy 8 ideation so as to keep the mind in the correct
                'relaxed' state while ideating.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/06-paper-prototype-01-ideation.png" alt="Crazy 8 exercise">

            <h2>Digital Paper Prototype</h2>
            <p>After some dot-voting and redrawing, the final low-fidelity screen designs are ready.</p>
            <p>I actually crashed Figjam because it is not meant for GIANT
                drawing files. Adobe Illustrator for iPad wins on this one.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/07-paper-prototype-02-design.png" alt="Second screen sketches">

            <h2>Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <p>Early user testing helped to validate the user flow, to confirm if user can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Find suitable walks
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gain information about these walks
                </li>
                <li>
                    Navigate these walks
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/08-paper-prototype-03-test.png" alt="Digital paper prototype">



            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>I wanted to know, overall, if users cloud flow smoothly through individual tasks that require searching,
                learning, decision making, navigating and analyzing data. The key questions were</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Can they find walks based on specific criteria?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can they save walks for later viewing, or add walks they like to their favorites list?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can they extract valuable insights about walks so they can better prepare?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can they use their walking history to recall details about their past walking experiences?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can they access the navigation feature correctly?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/10-paper-prototype-04.png" alt="Digital paper prototype">

            <h2>Retrospective</h2>

            <h3>"Our brains strive to turn everything into a routine"</h3>

            <p>One thing I like about having a structured process is that it fosters a routine where you always know
                what you have done,
                where you are, and
                what you should do next. I really think this is a great way to learn and progress without encountering
                burnout.
            </p>



            <h3>MASTERY</h3>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Does the work reflect the depth of our expertise, intuition and unique
                    capabilities?</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Was there a transfer of knowledge, wisdom or skills?</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Did the work help you learn or master a new tool, language, medium, or
                    material?</span>
                <br>

            <h2>Grey Boxing</h2>
            <p>I actually learned later that, when grey boxing, one should stick with only one or two shades of grey,
                so as not to
                give the wrong impression that the different shades of grey have a significant meaning. People are
                sensitive
                to color and even multiple shades of grey can be misleading.
            </p>
            <p>I am always a fan of giving unique names to my children: Rectangle 1,
                Rectangle 2, Rectangle 3...
            </p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/12-grey-boxing.png" alt="Grey boxing">

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>

            I find that visual design requires inspiration, persistence, breaks and A LOT sleep. Unlike programming,
            there is no
            compiler to micromanage my language.

            <h3>BEAUTY</h3>

            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Is the work iconic? Desirable? Evocative?</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Does the work feel elegant and simple in its solution?</span>
                <br>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Does the beauty of the work elevate the overall design and its
                    function?</span>

            <p>Dribble is inspiring, but it is also good to do a sanity check on some design ideas. Perhaps also to have
                some
                empathy for the developers who will build it.

            <h2>Responsive Screens</h2>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Hand sketched</h3>
            <p>Designing responsive screens takes forever, and makes me sometimes wish we could keep the UI minimal and
                go from Apple pencil
                straight to
                code.</p>

            <h2>Grey boxing with grids at breakpoints</h2>
            <p>Designing responsive screens is really about planning for all possible scenarios. It is more
                difficult than planning for native apps, even native apps that are designed to work on both mobile and
                tablet.

            </p>

            <h3>Planning for responsive screens with a variable 12-pt grid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>XS (Margin: 15, Gutter: 10)</li>
                <li>S (Margin: 20, Gutter: 20)</li>
                <li>M (Margin: 30, Gutter: 20)</li>
                <li>L (Margin: 35, Gutter: 25)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>MVP Screens</h3>
            <p>The logo is partially inspired by the dancing shrubs from Mario Bros 3. In all levels, the character will
                navigate through different
                stories on the corresponding map. On Level 1, which I believe was a sand theme, there would be a set of
                little green shrubs would dance
                back and
                fourth as Mario (or the chosen character) would move from
                story to story.</p>

            <h3>Design Changes</h3>
            <p>I tried very much to represent the categories with icons but they were not clear enough to the user.
                Photographic
                categories were much more clear and appealing to them.
            </p>


            <h3>What does it look like?</h3>
            <p>The app looks like a map based photo gallery. This solves the problem of the user wanting to have
                photographic evidence of their walk.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/walking-app/high-fi-raw-01.png" alt="Responsive home screen">

            <h3>What does it feel like?</h3>
            <p>When actually using the features, the app feels somewhat like a hotel booking app. You browse based on
                criteria,
                make selections likely based on the images seen and finally can drill down into more details about the
                selection. While the app is not for hotels, this feel does solve the problem of the user wanting to
                decide
                on which walk they would like to take.

            <h3>Expectations</h3>
            <p>In the beginning of the UI design process, I really thought I would be filling the app with new icons and
                illustrations however
                these things did not add significant value for the first MVP.

            <h2>Retrospective</h2>
            <h3>Some things I could have done better</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Figma's auto-layout feature. At the time of design, I had not learned to use the feature</li>
                <li>Reusable components. I found myself getting impatient and detached many instances during the design
                    process.</li>
                <li>Framer is very good for responsive web design and I would have wanted to explore it as well</li>
            </ul>

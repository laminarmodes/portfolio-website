            <p>
                Note: This work is purely for enjoyment and learning and so I am not diving into the details of
                accessibility.
                Accessibility is an important but also complicated subject because we all have our unique ways of
                integrating
                space and time
                and as they say, 'none of
                us is at the center of the bell curve'.
            </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <h3>WTF: What's this For?</h3>
            <p>In this project, I plugged a simplified NFT-style data model, data set and control logic into a SwiftUI
                design system. The
                the final app brings the design system to life as a living and testable product that can support complex
                user flows and
                information architecture.
            </p>
            <p>In this Swift User Interface, we can reconfigure and test:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 color sets
                </li>
                <li>
                    6 layouts for viewing and exploring information
                </li>
                <li>
                    3 different UI textures
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>and each permutation resides in the same app. <span style="font-weight:600">The User Interface is
                    available for public testing on iOS</span> <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/Ylmtp2l9"
                    target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:600">here</span></a></p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-1A-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">

            <p>I found through research that everyday users enjoy colorful user interfaces. Designers though are
                cautious in their
                use of color because they are very aware of the delight (and drama) that color is responsible for.
                Warm colors appear
                closer, cool colors more distant, red & blue together spark emotions
                and yellow, being the center wavelength, just hits us smack between the eyes.
            </p>
            <p>The programming language R
                gives access to
                several color-blind friendly maps for visualizing and interpreting complex data.</p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/two-color-maps.png" alt="Viridis and Magma color maps in R">

            <p>
                There is magic to color
                that goes beyond aesthetics though. Wavelength divition
                multiplexing (WDM) is
                a technology where large quantities of data are split into different light channels and transmitted
                simultaneously (the fiber bandwidth is increased). This perhaps can be observed physically; some
                research suggests that lightly tinted glasses of
                different
                colors can enhance depth perception.
            </p>

            <h3>UI Frameworks for native app development</h3>
            <p>Native Apps provide the best user experience, especially when accessing hardware and harnessing features
                such as AR. Native development is known to be expensive but the modern declarative frameworks such
                as SwiftUI for iOS and Jetpack Compose for Android make it building beautiful high quality user
                interfaces and apps more efficient. </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-1B-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">
            <p>
                In addition, KMP seems like a promising architecture where the SwiftUI or Jetpack Compose UI views
                can be driven by the same backend and logic. Just a note, this is a very simplified explanation
                of KMP. I am not a KMP expert so I won't go further into this :D
            </p>


            <h2>Using Data in the First Prototype</h2>
            <h3>Market Structure</h3>
            The data structure of this app has a steep hierarchy but is still very simple. It allows us to make multiple
            markets, where each market can have a set
            of
            flavors and each flavor can have
            a set of desserts. Excuse my handwriting, I wrioe this while lying down in bed.
            <img class="image-50" src="img/ui-desserts/hand-drawn-struct.png" alt="Data Model"
                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; padding-top: 2%;">
            <p>The data set really helps to bring the prototype to life while designing the user interface.
                We are able to see how the data appears on different textures
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Flat
                </li>
                <li>
                    Neumorphic
                </li>
                <li>
                    Glass
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-4A-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">
            <h3>Data Set</h3>
            <p>A large set of sample data is used to provide a prototyping data set that can be accessed by all of the
                views. For prototyping, I created an ObservableObject class with a dataset that
                uses the @Published property wrapper. It is called ObservableObject because SwiftUI monitors the
                ObservableObject which in turn will announces when changes to the data set occur.</p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/sample-data.jpeg" alt="Sample data in SwiftUI">
            <p>This was a lot of copy to write, 1200 Swift lines of copy in fact. And in making this I have learned a
                lot of fun facts about fruits and
                desserts :D</p>

            <h2>Icons</h2>
            <p>This is the first iteration of icons for each flavor (created in Figma). There is still more work to be
                done in order to
                make them look more consistent and like a family.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/process-icons.png" alt="Icons in figma">

            <h3>Warm color flavors</h3>
            <p>Lemon, Orange, Watermelon, Strawberry, Dragon Fruit, Plum, Raspberry, Blueberry</p>
            <p>This layout allows one to see, for one market, how many desserts there are for each flavor and a
                description of each flavor.</p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-5A-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">

            <h3>Cool color flavors</h3>
            <p>Avocado, Lime, Apple, Mint, Elderberry, Concord Grape, Lavendar, Blackberry</p>

            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-5B-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">

            <h2>Desserts</h2>
            <p>I created the pixel desserts in Figma. They are not the greatest but were quick to make and kind of cute.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sorbet
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ice Cream
                </li>
                <li>
                    Crushed Ice
                </li>
                <li>
                    Doughnuts
                </li>
                <li>
                    Crushed Ice
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smoothie
                </li>
                <li>
                    Candy
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cake
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Figma is actually not an optimal tool for making pixel art but throughout these projects I have been
                accumulating too many tools and
                subscriptions so I decide to cut down.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/process-desserts.svg" alt="Pixel desserts in figma">
            <p>
                For the prototype data set, I kept things simple and used the
                same set of desserts for each flavor.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/process-desserts-color.svg"
                alt="Pixel desserts in figma, set to flavor colors">
            <p>They need iteration (I drew them very quickly and spent most of the time getting the svgs into Xcode).
            </p>


            <h2>Exploring the Entire Market</h2>
            <p>The carousel allows you to visualize and explore, on one screen, all fruits within each flavor for one
                market.
                This was the most complicated layout to implement because it contained data and nested scroll views with
                headers.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-6A-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">
            <p>This view will also allow the user to add new desserts to any flavor. This is discussed in more detail at
                the very end.</p>

            <h2>A Pause</h2>
            <h3>Random Insight</h3>
            <p>
                I've been sharing so many screens so I thought it would be nice to have a breather. A random fact: I
                braid my own hair
                to make it easier to participate in swimming or sports. It's very easy (though being
                ambidextrous helps). I maintain it by doing 5 each day (or night).
            </p>

            <h2>Lazy Grid</h2>
            <p>This layout was a great opportunity to explore the benefits of the SwiftUI lazy grid. From a UI
                perspective, the layout
                allows the user to explore the desserts within one specific flavor.</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-7A-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">
            <!-- <p>As hopefully noticed by now :), I have been switching between a warm and cool color palette. It is well
                known that
                warm colors tend to appear closer while cool colors appear more distant and mixing warm with cool (e.g.
                red and blue)
                can create a strong emotional response.
            </p> -->
            <p>I could elaborate more on this but, I'm feeling lazy at the moment.</p>

            <h2>Navigating to details</h2>
            <h3>An Acknowledgement</h3>
            <p>I learned iOS development right before
                the
                COVID-19 pandemic started.
                Part of my background was in Computational Electromagnetics but I had not touched this since my academic
                years and really missed it. After going through Udacity to laern the concepts of UIKit, Networking,
                Native Authentication (dear lord, never again)
                and data persistance (Core Data), I transitioned to SwiftUI thanks to Meng To from Design+Code and
                Robert Petras from
                the Credo Academy who
                taught me how to create this lovely detailed view here.
            </p>
            <p>I know I have a little issue with the blue back-navigation over the pink (will sort that out later).</p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-2AB-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">


            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <h3>Adding new desserts</h3>
            <p>Designing and implementing a model form takes time. For this first iteration, I decided to keep
                it simple because it took awhile for me to get the prototype of the controller logic to properly allow
                for
                user input; adding a new dessert.
            </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-8-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">

            <h3>Adding new flavors</h3>
            <p>In addition to adding desserts, the user can add new flavours as well. And within the new flavor, can add
                more desserts. </p>
            <img class="image-100" src="img/ui-desserts/design-system-10-compressed.png" alt="UI Desserts in SwiftUI">

            <p>When testing this UI you will notice that each new
                dessert appears very instantly. For future iterations I am planning to add animations to make the data
                updates
                and transitions more smooth and engaging.
            </p>

            <h2>What's next?</h2>
            <h3>Using this design system to build practical productivity apps</h3>
            <p>This concludes the first version of my marketplace design. Feel free to test the UI here and leave
                feedback. As for what is next, I plan to use this project to develop and maintain a design system that I
                can
